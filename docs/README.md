# Write Documentation for you Code

Clear and organized documentation about the code will help user to reuse the code and collaborators to easily understand the code.
Split documentation in two types: end-user documentation and developer's documentation.

- End-user documentation describes how to use the code through examples.
- Devopers documentation describe the insides of the code in detailed, or at leas as good enough such that a collaborator (developer) can quickly set a development environment and get ready to code.

## How to Document?

- Docstrings, a.k.a comment the code
- Write lengthy explanations using dedicated documentation generators, e.g. [Sphinx](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html), [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/)
